Assignement for my Xello Full-Stack developer application.

Objective
- Create a single page Angular 4+ app with simple routing that has one state/view. In it, place two buttons that when clicked; show a tooltip above the button with some text in it. 
- When button A is clicked, if button Bâ€™s tooltip is open it should close and vice versa - only one tooltip should be visible at a time. Either tooltip should close when clicked anywhere outside of it, but remain open if clicked inside. Either tooltip should close when ESC key is pressed.

Implementation:
- Tooltip functionality should be written as a reusable component
- You are encouraged to use a starter/seed project to save time scaffolding
- You can organize the files/folders in any way
- The reviewer should be able to run your solution with a simple npm command
- You should submit your solution as a github repository link

Bonus:
- Done => If you scroll down to an open tooltip it should detect being at the edge of the screen and change position to be below the button +++
- Done => Style using Bootstrap sass ++
- Done (keyboard navigation + adding border when focus) => Add at least one accessibility feature +

To run:
ng serve -o
